# Message Processing

## Assignment 

System A generates messages (simple strings) in random way. That system may generate N messages per second and then be idle for hours. Every message has its own priority.
System B can process messages in some way, e.g. by sending them to stdout/console. Message processing logic is very slow, it is limited by 1 message/second.
Processing should be priority based - messages with higher priority must be processed first. 
No messages generated by the System A can be lost, all messages should be processed according to their priority.

## Implemented with .NET 7 + RabbitMQ

The solution contains two simple background services - publisher and subscriber. RabbitMQ priority queue is used (with max priority level = 10)

*I assume RabbitMQ is running on localhost with default port 5672*
